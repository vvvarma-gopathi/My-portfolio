                AIM/OBJECTIVE: <br>
                The main aim and objective of this project is to facilitate asynchronous
                conversations between users through dedicated chatrooms and ensure highly
                secure communication via text messages. <br>
                INTRODUCTION: <br>
                â–ªIn order to develop the asynchronous communication between the users a web
                socket connection is established, where the client do not want to send http
                requests repeatedly to send or receive messages. <br>
                â–ªUser can signup or create an account by providing the user name,e-mail id and
                password this user information is saved in the data base. The password that
                user provided in the time of signup is hashed for the additional security. <br>
                â–ªAfter successful signup, the page automatically redirected to login page where
                the user can login into their account by providing the username and password
                which is given during the signup. <br>
                â–ªAfter login, it shows all available chatrooms user can join the chat room by
                providing the password of that particular rom for the security reasons and start
                messaging with the users who joined the same chatroom these messages are
                saved in the data base and only visible to the users who are in the same chat room. <br>
